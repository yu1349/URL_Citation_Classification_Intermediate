This is rarely the case, as shown by various studies in NLG (Stent et al., 2005 [URL_CITE] ; Belz and Reiter, 2006; Reiter and Belz, 2009), as well as in related fields, such as dialogue systems (Liu et al., 2016), machine translation (MT) (Callison-Burch et al., 2006), and image captioning (Elliott and Keller, 2014; Kilick-aya et al., 2017).

To operationalise this mapping, we propose that set-theoretic models, like distributions, can be expressed in terms of vec-tors \u2013 giving us a common representation across for-malisms. Using a publicly available dataset of feature norms annotated with quantifiers [URL_CITE] (Herbelot and Vec-chi, 2015), we show that human-like intuitions about the quantification of simple subject/predicate pairs can be induced from standard distributional data.\nFootnote or Reference text (if exists): 1 Data available at http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/\u02dcah433/mcrae-quantified-majority.txt\nSection Titles (if exists):  ['1 Introduction']"

In efforts to overcome this data scarcity problem, recent years have seen the development of techniques for rapidly adapt-ing multilingual or language-independent acoustic and language models to new languages from rela-tively small amounts of data (Schultz and Waibel, 2001; Kim and Khudanpur, 2003), methods for building resources such as pronunciation dictio-naries from web-crawled data (Schlippe et al., 2014), and even a web-based interface, the Rapid Language Adaptation Toolkit [URL_CITE] (RLAT), which al-lows non-expert users to exploit these techniques to create speech recognition and synthesis tools for new languages (Vu et al., 2010). While they greatly reduce the amount of data needed to build new recognizers, these approaches still require non-trivial amounts of speech and text in the target language, which may be an obstacle for very low-or zero-resource languages.\nFootnote or Reference text (if exists): 4 http://i19pc5.ira.uka.de/rlat-dev\nSection Titles (if exists):  ['2 Background and related work']"

For example look at Sears, Sears didn\u2019t care what went on inside, it was all about the _appearance_ of its location, the prestige of the location, the facilities and so on. It didn\u2019t care about how long it took it to operate, it was about how much people would pay to go see it. Sears was a landmark as a cultural movement and other big companies followed suit, so if you want to see a building you\u2019ve never seen before, you have to go see Sears, just like you have to see a Toyota Camry for Toyota Camry. They used to be all about building new factories, some of them if I recall, but now that they\u2019re bigger, that means that more factory jobs are coming to them. You\u2019ve probably seen them in stores as stores where people buy and sell stuff, so there aren\u2019t that many places for them to come from.

In efforts to overcome this data scarcity problem, recent years have seen the development of techniques for rapidly adapt-ing multilingual or language-independent acoustic and language models to new languages from rela-tively small amounts of data (Schultz and Waibel, 2001; Kim and Khudanpur, 2003), methods for building resources such as pronunciation dictio-naries from web-crawled data (Schlippe et al., 2014), and even a web-based interface, the Rapid Language Adaptation Toolkit [URL_CITE] (RLAT), which al-lows non-expert users to exploit these techniques to create speech recognition and synthesis tools for new languages (Vu et al., 2010). While they greatly reduce the amount of data needed to build new recognizers, these approaches still require non-trivial amounts of speech and text in the target language, which may be an obstacle for very low-or zero-resource languages.\nFootnote or Reference text (if exists): 4 http://i19pc5.ira.uka.de/rlat-dev\nSection Titles (if exists):  ['2 Background and related work']"

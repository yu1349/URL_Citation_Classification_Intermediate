Adversarial perturbations have been widely studied to assess the robustness of NLP systems against adversarial samples crafted to fool a model (Alshemali and Kalita, 2020; Ren et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020 [URL_CITE] ). However, adversarial samples resemble a very specific type of noise.\nFootnote or Reference text (if exists): Wei Emma Zhang, Quan Z. Sheng, Ahoud Alhazmi, and Chenliang Li. 2020.

When compared to textual entailment (TE)/natural language infer-ence (Dagan et al., 2009 [URL_CITE] ; Bowman et al., 2015), the key difference is that in these tasks the passage to verify each claim is given, and in recent years it typically consists a single sentence, while in veri-fication systems it is retrieved from a large set of documents in order to form the evidence. Another related task is question answering (QA), for which approaches have recently been extended to han-dle large-scale resources such as Wikipedia (Chen et al., 2017).\nFootnote or Reference text (if exists): Ido Dagan, Bill Dolan, Bernardo Magnini, and Dan Roth. 2009.

When compared to textual entailment (TE)/natural language infer-ence (Dagan et al., 2009 [URL_CITE] ; Bowman et al., 2015), the key difference is that in these tasks the passage to verify each claim is given, and in recent years it typically consists a single sentence, while in veri-fication systems it is retrieved from a large set of documents in order to form the evidence. Another related task is question answering (QA), for which approaches have recently been extended to han-dle large-scale resources such as Wikipedia (Chen et al., 2017).\nFootnote or Reference text (if exists): Ido Dagan, Bill Dolan, Bernardo Magnini, and Dan Roth. 2009.

Scaling up from Jernite (2020) [URL_CITE] , who used a mini-batch size of 512 and initialized their retriever with BERT, we use much large mini-batches of size 12,288 (and hence, many more negative examples) and initial-ize our retriever with a strong pretrained retriever, the REALM model (Guu et al., 2020) trained on the Common Crawl News (CC-News) corpus.

For example look at Sears, Sears didn\u2019t care what went on inside, it was all about the _appearance_ of its location, the prestige of the location, the facilities and so on. It didn\u2019t care about how long it took it to operate, it was about how much people would pay to go see it. Sears was a landmark as a cultural movement and other big companies followed suit, so if you want to see a building you\u2019ve never seen before, you have to go see Sears, just like you have to see a Toyota Camry for Toyota Camry. They used to be all about building new factories, some of them if I recall, but now that they\u2019re bigger, that means that more factory jobs are coming to them. You\u2019ve probably seen them in stores as stores where people buy and sell stuff, so there aren\u2019t that many places for them to come from.

This large set of supertags in TAG presents a severe challenge in supertagging and causes a large discrepancy in parsing performance with gold supertags and predicted supertags (Ban-galore et al., 2009 [URL_CITE] ; Chung et al., 2016; Kasai et al., 2017).\nFootnote or Reference text (if exists): Srinivas Bangalore, Pierre Boullier, Alexis Nasr, Owen Rambow, and Beno\u0131\u0302t Sagot. 2009.

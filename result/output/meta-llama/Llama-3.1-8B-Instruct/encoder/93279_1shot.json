Com-pared to the previous work (Fang et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2018a) which transfers a policy learned on a source task to target task, our dream-based AL query policies are consistently more effective even when the data domain and annotation scheme of target task are different from the source task.\nFootnote or Reference text (if exists): 1 Source code is available at https://github.com/trangvu/alil-dream\nSection Titles (if exists):  ['1 Introduction']"

Our recent work (Kacorri et al., 2015) [URL_CITE] has established a set of de-mographic and technology experience questions which can be used to screen for the most critical participants in a user study of ASL signers to eval-uate animation.

It didn\u2019t care about how long it took it to operate, it was about how much people would pay to go see it.

They used to be all about building new factories, some of them if I recall, but now that they\u2019re bigger, that means that more factory jobs are coming to them. You\u2019ve probably seen them in stores as stores where people buy and sell stuff, so there aren\u2019t that many places for them to come from.

The resulting lexicon can then be used with the HRL recognizer to add small-vocabulary speech recognition functionality to applications in the LRL, without the need for the large amounts of data and expertise in speech technologies required to train a new recognizer. This paper describes the lex4all application and its utility for the rapid creation and evaluation of pronunciation lexicons enabling small-vocabulary speech recognition in any language.\nFootnote or Reference text (if exists): 1 http://lex4all.github.io/lex4all/\nSection Titles (if exists):  ['1 Introduction']"

We extend pre-viously proposed BiLSTM-based models (Lewis et al., 2016; Kasai et al., 2017) in three ways: 1) we add character-level Convolutional Neural Net-works (CNNs) to the input layer, 2) we perform concatenation of both directions of the LSTM not only after the final layer but also after each layer, and 3) we use a modified BiLSTM with highway connections.\nFootnote or Reference text (if exists): Jungo Kasai, Robert Frank, Tom McCoy, Owen Rambow, and Alexis Nasr. 2017.

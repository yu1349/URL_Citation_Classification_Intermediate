The resulting lexicon can then be used with the HRL recognizer to add small-vocabulary speech recognition functionality to applications in the LRL, without the need for the large amounts of data and expertise in speech technologies required to train a new recognizer.

With token alignment, we can identify the text spans that are edited and thus can annotate the edited text spans in the original sentences as erroneous spans.\nFootnote or Reference text (if exists): 1 Alignment can be solved by dynamic programming like Levenshtein distance.

We discuss some of the differences in annotation style and source material that make a direct com-parison problematic. Some first steps at analysis of the parsing results indicate aspects of the anno-tation style that are difficult for the parser, and also show that the parser is creating structures that are not present in the training material.\nFootnote or Reference text (if exists): Anthony Kroch, Beatrice Santorini, and Ariel Dier-tani. 2010.

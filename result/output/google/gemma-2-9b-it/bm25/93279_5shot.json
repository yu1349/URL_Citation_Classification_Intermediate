To operationalise this mapping, we propose that set-theoretic models, like distributions, can be expressed in terms of vec-tors \u2013 giving us a common representation across for-malisms. Using a publicly available dataset of feature norms annotated with quantifiers [URL_CITE] (Herbelot and Vec-chi, 2015), we show that human-like intuitions about the quantification of simple subject/predicate pairs can be induced from standard distributional data.\nFootnote or Reference text (if exists): 1 Data available at http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/\u02dcah433/mcrae-quantified-majority.txt\nSection Titles (if exists):  ['1 Introduction']"

Despite achieving better overall results, supervised systems require tremendous efforts in order to produce data for several languages (Navigli, 2018; Pasini, 2020), whereas knowledge-based approaches can easily be applied in multilingual environments due to the wide array of languages covered by LKBs like Ba-belNet [URL_CITE] (Navigli and Ponzetto, 2012), or the Open Multilingual WordNet (Bond and Foster, 2013). Moreover, it is widely acknowledged that the per-formance of a knowledge-based WSD system is strongly correlated with the structure of the LKB employed (Boyd-Graber et al., 2006; Lemnitzer et al., 2008; Navigli and Lapata, 2010; Ponzetto and Navigli, 2010).\nFootnote or Reference text (if exists): 1 https://babelnet.org/\nSection Titles (if exists):  ['1 Introduction']"

In efforts to overcome this data scarcity problem, recent years have seen the development of techniques for rapidly adapt-ing multilingual or language-independent acoustic and language models to new languages from rela-tively small amounts of data (Schultz and Waibel, 2001; Kim and Khudanpur, 2003), methods for building resources such as pronunciation dictio-naries from web-crawled data (Schlippe et al., 2014), and even a web-based interface, the Rapid Language Adaptation Toolkit [URL_CITE] (RLAT), which al-lows non-expert users to exploit these techniques to create speech recognition and synthesis tools for new languages (Vu et al., 2010). While they greatly reduce the amount of data needed to build new recognizers, these approaches still require non-trivial amounts of speech and text in the target language, which may be an obstacle for very low-or zero-resource languages.\nFootnote or Reference text (if exists): 4 http://i19pc5.ira.uka.de/rlat-dev\nSection Titles (if exists):  ['2 Background and related work']"

In the SIM method of Section 3.1 all set elements that have a feature vec-tor (i.e., context vector) similar to e are removed. The Feature Modification Method (FMM) instead tries to identify the subset of features of the error e which represent the unintended sense of the seed terms S. For example, let S = {Minerva, Neptune, Baccus, Juno, Apollo}. Looking at the contexts of these words in a large corpus, we construct a cen-troid context vector for S by taking a weighted av-erage of the contexts of the seeds in S.

Despite achieving better overall results, supervised systems require tremendous efforts in order to produce data for several languages (Navigli, 2018; Pasini, 2020), whereas knowledge-based approaches can easily be applied in multilingual environments due to the wide array of languages covered by LKBs like Ba-belNet [URL_CITE] (Navigli and Ponzetto, 2012), or the Open Multilingual WordNet (Bond and Foster, 2013). Moreover, it is widely acknowledged that the per-formance of a knowledge-based WSD system is strongly correlated with the structure of the LKB employed (Boyd-Graber et al., 2006; Lemnitzer et al., 2008; Navigli and Lapata, 2010; Ponzetto and Navigli, 2010).\nFootnote or Reference text (if exists): 1 https://babelnet.org/\nSection Titles (if exists):  ['1 Introduction']"

In efforts to overcome this data scarcity problem, recent years have seen the development of techniques for rapidly adapt-ing multilingual or language-independent acoustic and language models to new languages from rela-tively small amounts of data (Schultz and Waibel, 2001; Kim and Khudanpur, 2003), methods for building resources such as pronunciation dictio-naries from web-crawled data (Schlippe et al., 2014), and even a web-based interface, the Rapid Language Adaptation Toolkit [URL_CITE] (RLAT), which al-lows non-expert users to exploit these techniques to create speech recognition and synthesis tools for new languages (Vu et al., 2010). While they greatly reduce the amount of data needed to build new recognizers, these approaches still require non-trivial amounts of speech and text in the target language, which may be an obstacle for very low-or zero-resource languages.\nFootnote or Reference text (if exists): 4 http://i19pc5.ira.uka.de/rlat-dev\nSection Titles (if exists):  ['2 Background and related work']"

Scaling up from Jernite (2020) [URL_CITE] , who used a mini-batch size of 512 and initialized their retriever with BERT, we use much large mini-batches of size 12,288 (and hence, many more negative examples) and initial-ize our retriever with a strong pretrained retriever, the REALM model (Guu et al., 2020) trained on the Common Crawl News (CC-News) corpus. These design decisions greatly improve retriever qual-ity, as we observe in an ablation study (see Ap-pendix A.2).\nFootnote or Reference text (if exists): Yacine Jernite. 2020.

In efforts to overcome this data scarcity problem, recent years have seen the development of techniques for rapidly adapt-ing multilingual or language-independent acoustic and language models to new languages from rela-tively small amounts of data (Schultz and Waibel, 2001; Kim and Khudanpur, 2003), methods for building resources such as pronunciation dictio-naries from web-crawled data (Schlippe et al., 2014), and even a web-based interface, the Rapid Language Adaptation Toolkit [URL_CITE] (RLAT), which al-lows non-expert users to exploit these techniques to create speech recognition and synthesis tools for new languages (Vu et al., 2010). While they greatly reduce the amount of data needed to build new recognizers, these approaches still require non-trivial amounts of speech and text in the target language, which may be an obstacle for very low-or zero-resource languages.\nFootnote or Reference text (if exists): 4 http://i19pc5.ira.uka.de/rlat-dev\nSection Titles (if exists):  ['2 Background and related work']"

Despite achieving better overall results, supervised systems require tremendous efforts in order to produce data for several languages (Navigli, 2018; Pasini, 2020), whereas knowledge-based approaches can easily be applied in multilingual environments due to the wide array of languages covered by LKBs like Ba-belNet [URL_CITE] (Navigli and Ponzetto, 2012), or the Open Multilingual WordNet (Bond and Foster, 2013). Moreover, it is widely acknowledged that the per-formance of a knowledge-based WSD system is strongly correlated with the structure of the LKB employed (Boyd-Graber et al., 2006; Lemnitzer et al., 2008; Navigli and Lapata, 2010; Ponzetto and Navigli, 2010).\nFootnote or Reference text (if exists): 1 https://babelnet.org/\nSection Titles (if exists):  ['1 Introduction']"

The result is a graph whose vertices are BabelNet synsets that contain at least one WordNet synset and whose edge set includes all those relations in BabelNet coming either from WordNet itself or from links in other resources mapped to Word-Net (such as hyperlinks in a Wikipedia article con-necting it to other articles).

Given that measuring this score against all sentences in a corpus grows quadratically with respect to cor-pus length, we use the following two heuristics to remove sentences with high overlap in an effi-cient manner: (1) scoring similarity between the 50 alphabetically-sorted previous sentences, (2): ex-tracting the top 100K four-grams and performing the similarity score within each group of sentences containing at least one instance of a certain four-gram.\nFootnote or Reference text (if exists): 6 https://github.com/maxbachmann/ RapidFuzz pseudo monolingual data and dictionaries\nSection Titles (if exists):  ['2 A FRO MT benchmark', '2.3 Data Preparation']"

Despite achieving better overall results, supervised systems require tremendous efforts in order to produce data for several languages (Navigli, 2018; Pasini, 2020), whereas knowledge-based approaches can easily be applied in multilingual environments due to the wide array of languages covered by LKBs like Ba-belNet [URL_CITE] (Navigli and Ponzetto, 2012), or the Open Multilingual WordNet (Bond and Foster, 2013). Moreover, it is widely acknowledged that the per-formance of a knowledge-based WSD system is strongly correlated with the structure of the LKB employed (Boyd-Graber et al., 2006; Lemnitzer et al., 2008; Navigli and Lapata, 2010; Ponzetto and Navigli, 2010).\nFootnote or Reference text (if exists): 1 https://babelnet.org/\nSection Titles (if exists):  ['1 Introduction']"

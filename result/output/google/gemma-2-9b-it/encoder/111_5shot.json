The experiment results demon-strate the ability of our method to quickly learn a good policy directly on the task of interest. Com-pared to the previous work (Fang et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2018a) which transfers a policy learned on a source task to target task, our dream-based AL query policies are consistently more effective even when the data domain and annotation scheme of target task are different from the source task.\nFootnote or Reference text (if exists): 1 Source code is available at https://github.com/trangvu/alil-dream\nSection Titles (if exists):  ['1 Introduction']"

When compared to textual entailment (TE)/natural language infer-ence (Dagan et al., 2009 [URL_CITE] ; Bowman et al., 2015), the key difference is that in these tasks the passage to verify each claim is given, and in recent years it typically consists a single sentence, while in veri-fication systems it is retrieved from a large set of documents in order to form the evidence. Another related task is question answering (QA), for which approaches have recently been extended to han-dle large-scale resources such as Wikipedia (Chen et al., 2017).\nFootnote or Reference text (if exists): Ido Dagan, Bill Dolan, Bernardo Magnini, and Dan Roth. 2009.

In contrast to standard adversarial networks (Goodfellow et al., 2014) [URL_CITE] , which serve as a tool for minimizing the divergence between two distributions (Nowozin et al., 2016), MANs represent a family of theoret-ically sound adversarial networks that, in contrast, leverage a multinomial discriminator to directly minimize the divergence among multiple proba-bility distributions.

The main idea of MAN is to ex-plicitly model the domain-invariant features that are beneficial to the main classification task across all domains (i.e. the shared features, extracted by F s ), as well as the domain-specific features that mainly contribute to the classification in its own domain (the domain features, extracted by F d ).\nFootnote or Reference text (if exists): Konstantinos Bousmalis, George Trigeorgis, Nathan Silberman, Dilip Krishnan, and Dumitru Erhan. 2016.

Despite achieving better overall results, supervised systems require tremendous efforts in order to produce data for several languages (Navigli, 2018; Pasini, 2020), whereas knowledge-based approaches can easily be applied in multilingual environments due to the wide array of languages covered by LKBs like Ba-belNet [URL_CITE] (Navigli and Ponzetto, 2012), or the Open Multilingual WordNet (Bond and Foster, 2013). Moreover, it is widely acknowledged that the per-formance of a knowledge-based WSD system is strongly correlated with the structure of the LKB employed (Boyd-Graber et al., 2006; Lemnitzer et al., 2008; Navigli and Lapata, 2010; Ponzetto and Navigli, 2010).\nFootnote or Reference text (if exists): 1 https://babelnet.org/\nSection Titles (if exists):  ['1 Introduction']"

We use the \u201copenNLP\u201d software (Northedge, 2005) [URL_CITE] to parse a large amount of sentences in the LDC English Gi-gaword corpus to generate an automatic treebank, which has a slightly different word-tokenization than that of the manual treebank such as the Upenn Treebank used in (Chelba and Jelinek, 2000). For the 44 and 230 million tokens corpora, all sentences are automatically parsed and used to initialize model parameters, while for 1.3 billion tokens corpus, we parse the sentences from a portion of the corpus that contain 230 million tokens, then use them to initial-ize model parameters.\nFootnote or Reference text (if exists): R.
